This code is an interesting (but not working) example of me trying to parse some string,
in this case a roman numeral, before I was introduced with proper IO handling, more
specifically IO streams. As one would check the code, it becomes quite obvious, that
the code is messy (although the basic concepts seem to be OK), and needs serious
restructuring.

The reason I left it in its current state, is because while I was working on the
Librarian project, I encountered a similar situation there as well (from a learning
perspective), but I did not think at the time to save the code at that stage. Because
of that, the opportunity was lost to analize the difference between two very different
approaches of coding, which was about error handling. This time, this opportunity is
still present, so let's see how it will turn out after I write a fix some time later...
