This repository contains only small projects that I use as tools to learn C or C++ programming.
Not everything gets uploaded, only code that deals with some (at the time) interesting problems.
Also, since these little projects are only used for educational purposes, no mature code
is to be expected.

Please feel free to browse the repo anyway, as all suggestions are welcome!
